	<p>Many of these flowers were taken around my home! They're usually pink and white, but sometimes red ones will bloom! I started taking these pictures since 2019 but I'll show some of the ones I really like! This tree shows the two kinds of Pinks to bloom!</p>

 <p>This is from Disneyland and I thought these were SO pretty! They look like pink bell flowers, but on threes. I had a bit of a hard time getting this because there were so many people.</p>

 <p>These yellow ones are in my grandparent's front yard! I love how the petals fold outward so delicately! So beautiful!</p>

 <p>I don't remember where we were, but I thought these hot pink ones were so interesting! The white parts in the center where the pollen is, is so strange but pretty!</p>
