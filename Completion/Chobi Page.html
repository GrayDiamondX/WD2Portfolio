<p>Chobi is head strong! He loves trying new things, even if its out of his comfort zone! Chobi wants to see the passion in your eyes and make sure that you’ve got this! If you ever feel like you’re not good enough, he knows  that feeling and doesn’t want anyone to go through that. He’ll give you words of excitement, adventure, and most of all, support; believing you can do it and he’ll be right next to you thw whole way.<br><br>

Chobi was a little hard for me to write because many of my friends think of him as mean or evil, but all the fairies are meant for encouragement and the different types of positivity. I don’t want others to only think of him as evil just by looking at him, hes meant to have a look of adventure and excitement.<br><br>

Chobi is a way for me to be able to drive alone, ride the train alone, and even ignite my passion for art when I have artist block. </p>
