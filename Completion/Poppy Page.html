<p>Poppy loves having fun! She loves cracking jokes in hopes of seeing you smile! She’ll pull up funny memes and videos she knows will make you laugh. If nothing else works, she’ll get help from her friends, working together and giving you a little show! Poppy doesn’t like the quiet, so she’ll even do some funny dance moves if it’ll get you to smile.<br><br>

Poppy is all the silliness and memes. She loves making good-hearted jokes and seeing the genuine smiles they bring. Poppy wants to be someone you rely on when you’re feeling sad and want a good laugh. Poppy knows what its like to feel left out of fun and when to stop if things get too serious because she doesn’t want to go overboard.<br><br>

Poppy is some I wish I had when I was younger; someone who would always be there for me when I was down and knew how to make me laugh when times got really rough.</p>
