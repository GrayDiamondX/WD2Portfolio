<p>Lottie doesn’t talk, they’re mute. Instead, Lottie will make sure you’re okay by bringing you a few snacks or candy, check any spelling errors on your homework, and most importantly, making sure you’re well rested. They know life can be tough, and they’ve seen it thousands of times. They hope their efforts can bring you some comfort in knowing that someone cares, even if there is no one else.<br><br>

Lottie represents calmness as they’re more relaxed than the others. Lottie wants you to feel okay and know that there is someone there for you. They don’t mind if all you want to do is take a nap, write or read something, or just stay in each other’s company in silence.<br><br>

Lottie is meant for all the times I’ve felt angry or restless. They, despite being a caffeine, is the most calm and attentive.</p>
